-- base limb

store info somewhere on here? So we can recreate the skeleton when necessary?

create UI

start w joint chain
orient and place those (use controls to get scale? maybe just parented under joints)

create FK skel
create IK skel (option)
create combo skel

mirror stuff

set rotate order on all (UI)

set up blend procedures for blending joints

create Fk controls

create Ik controls 

create fkIK switch
hook blends and controls vis into swtich

setup stretch (create measure skeleton)

create twist extractors (option for upper, lower [or more accurately forward, reverse]) and twist joints under combo rig

**rewrite ribbon stuff. . . 

*mocap stuff should be put ON TOP of these controls
*export rig should be put UNDER all of these things

package it all up
